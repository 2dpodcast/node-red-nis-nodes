<h3>Benchmark</h3>
<p>Time a block of code with minimal effort.
Sometimes you want to time a certain execution path to see its performance. So, you add a bunch of time captures and log statements. Cleaning them up is not so much fun. It would also be nice to leave them in your code so they can be enabled at will. timeMe is meant to help in that situation.

timeMe Will take some options and a function to wrap. It will return the wrapped function. Everytime that function is executed, its time will be recorded. You can choose to print it out, or query the function for its lastTime.</p>

<p>This node requires <strong>msg.callback()</strong> be called at the end of a flow</p>
